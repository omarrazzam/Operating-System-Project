# OPsessed
OPsessed is a simulation for an operating system that implemented using Java. It can handle system calls Like reading and writing from user input and output and access to critical resources while being managed by a secure locking system to ensure Validity of Data.

OPsessed can simulate parallelism using a scheduler that runs the Round-Robin swapping algorthim. This enforces fair use of critical resources and maximizes effeciency. OPsessed also Has a text parser that reades instructions from text files and inserts them into the memory when it's time for the process to run.

OPsessed can handle executing and Swapping between a maximum of 3 Programs at the same time.
